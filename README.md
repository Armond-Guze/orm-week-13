This back end database has been created for e-commerce websites using a functional Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The back end application allows users to create the schema, seed the database, and sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start. The application utilizes object-relational mapping for interaction with the database to perform operations such as data manipulation, storage, and retrieval.
